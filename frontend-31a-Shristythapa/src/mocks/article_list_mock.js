    body: "As a web developer and design lackey, I really appreciate a well-put together website. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to register for a site when they ask you for all of your personal information and you don’t even know what it is you’re getting yet.\n\nIt’s also a bummer when the site design isn’t as intuitive as it should be. We know, as internet users, that usually your account profile on a website includes everything like billing, prior transactions, reviews, feedback, or whatever. When a site makes you have to hunt to perform simple functions it becomes frustrating for the user and likely acts a deterrent for them to be repeat visitor. User interface (UI) is incredibly important to the success of your business or venture.\n\nAvoid a design calamity and pay attention to these vital UI design patterns. Learn how to develop effective and high traffic sites from the ground up in this design fundamentals course.",

    body: "Have you ever wanted to build developer tooling for Dart and Flutter but didn’t know where to start? Or maybe you didn’t want to go through all the work of establishing a connection to a running Dart or Flutter application to access debugging data? Then, even if you did create a development tool, how would you deploy it or give users easy access to it? Well, we have some good news for you: now you can create developer tooling without all these hurdles.\r\n\r\nWith the new Dart & Flutter DevTools extensions framework, you can easily build developer tooling that is tightly integrated with the existing DevTools tooling suite. Extensions are built using Flutter web and leverage existing frameworks and utilities from DevTools to simplify the developer tool authoring experience.\r\n\r\n",

    body: "If it feels like the future of AI is a rapidly changing landscape, that’s because the present innovations in the field of artificial intelligence are accelerating at such a blazing-fast pace that it’s tough to keep up.\r\n\r\nIndeed, artificial intelligence is shaping the future of humanity across nearly every industry. It is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT — not to mention generative AI, with tools like ChatGPT and AI art generators garnering mainstream attention — and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the foreseeable future. \r\n\r\nRoughly 44 percent of companies are looking to make serious investments in AI and integrate it into their businesses. And of the 9,130 patents received by IBM inventors in 2021, 2,300 were AI-related.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that AI is going to (continue to) change the world. But how, exactly?\r\n\r\nMORE ON THE FUTURE OF AI\r\nCan AI Make Art More Human?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Evolution of AI\r\nAI’s influence on technology is due in part because of how it impacts computing. Through AI, computers have the ability to harness massive amounts of data and use their learned intelligence to make optimal decisions and discoveries in fractions of the time that it would take humans.\r\n\r\nAI has come a long way since 1951, when the first documented success of an AI computer program was written by Christopher Strachey, whose checkers program completed a whole game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester.\r\n\r\nSince then, AI has been used to help sequence RNA for vaccines and model human speech, technologies that rely on model- and algorithm-based machine learning and increasingly focus on perception, reasoning and generalization. With innovations like these, AI has re-taken center stage like never before — and it won’t cede the spotlight anytime soon. ",
