  body: "Have you ever wanted to build developer tooling for Dart and Flutter but didn’t know where to start? Or maybe you didn’t want to go through all the work of establishing a connection to a running Dart or Flutter application to access debugging data? Then, even if you did create a development tool, how would you deploy it or give users easy access to it? Well, we have some good news for you: now you can create developer tooling without all these hurdles.\r\n\r\nWith the new Dart & Flutter DevTools extensions framework, you can easily build developer tooling that is tightly integrated with the existing DevTools tooling suite. Extensions are built using Flutter web and leverage existing frameworks and utilities from DevTools to simplify the developer tool authoring experience.\r\n\r\n",
